# Week6
Explanation of the Project
This "Task List Manager" fulfills all parts of the assignment:

Part 1: JavaScript Basics - Uses variables (tasks, showCompleted, maxTasks), conditionals (isValidTask), and console-like output via DOM updates.
Part 2: Functions - Includes addTask, toggleTaskCompletion, isValidTask, and updateStatusMessage for reusable logic.
Part 3: Loops - Implements a forEach loop in renderTasks to display tasks and a while loop to count completed tasks.
Part 4: DOM Manipulation - Features three interactions: adding tasks via button click, toggling the filter for completed tasks, and updating the status message with a visual effect.

The project is commented clearly, organized by assignment parts, and styled with CSS for a polished look. Users can add up to 10 tasks, mark them as complete/undo, and filter to show only completed tasks. The status message provides feedback for all actions.
